# Google Merchendise Store Analytics with Google Analytics and Python

### Introduction

In the scope of “Web Analytics” course and in order to complete this course’s
assignment, our team retrieved data from Google Merchandise Store, which we
accessed through Google Analytics platform and the Demo Account that it’s available
for such use. The main goal of this work focuses on delivering a Data Analysis Report,
which will reveal significant issues that the e-shop has to deal with and
simultaneously, will contribute to their resolution by providing specific proposals for
each one of them. Hopefully, the results of this analysis will urge e-shop’s stakeholders
to conduct further investigation and take actions to improve the problems our team
has noticed, in order to optimize its whole functionality.
We followed five steps in order to fulfill our goal. First of all, we defined the period
that we were going to analyze, which will provide us a wide view over e-shop analytics
results and provide indications to be used for our further suggestions. Then, we chose
the most crucial KPI’s we thought will be valuable for our survey and constructed our
metrics report by asking significant questions and answering with specific data
retrieved from Google Analytics source. Following, we quoted the data gathered from
the above-mentioned export and analyzed them to detect insights that will be
subjected to further examination. To ascertain that these interesting observations did
not happen by chance, we used the Scientific Python (Scipy) and statistical Python
libraries (Stats.models) for statistical analysis (namely normality, difference of means
and correlation tests), to further analyze the data and confirm whether our
observations are statistically significant. Eventually, we discussed our findings and
propose improvements valuable for consulting e-shop’s management.

### Main Elements’ Definition
As already mentioned, our team decided to establish a certain time period in which all
significant metrics will be examined.
The chosen time period is between January to March 2018 and the relevant period for
year 2019, namely January to March. We examined these quarters, between two
successive years, because we wanted to interpret audience behaviors and other
indications that will lead us to form a better strategy for the relevant forthcoming
quarter of 2020 [1, 2].
The next element that concerned us was what KPI’s are interesting to be examined to
form an interesting first metrics report with them. So, we ended up to the following:

### KPI’s
• Number of Visits per User
• Unique & Returning Visitors
• Visitors’ Location
• Visitors’ Demographics
• Users by Browsers & Devices
• Landing Pages
• Exit Pages
• Frequently visited pages
• Session Duration by Users
• Pages per Session
• Bounce Rate
• Bounce Rate by Browsers
• Average Page Load Time
• Conversion Rate
Furthermore, we answered the following questions in order to make useful
comparative tables of the before-mentioned data (shown in the metrics report), so as
to learn more about e-shop audience behavior, as well about our e-shop’s
performance [3]:
• What is our Audience?
• Do we have visitors who return to our site?
• What is our demographics’ distribution?
• Is our website interesting enough for our users?
• Do we have any insights regarding browsers? May they have any issues?
• How is the website traffic developing?
• What is the website’s organic traffic?
• Do we have quality in our traffic? How much time do the visitors need to
convert or bounce?
• What is our pages speed?
• How much time do our visitors spend in our pages?
• How many pages are being visited?
• What is our conversion rate? Do visitors get what they need?
